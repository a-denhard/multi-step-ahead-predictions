# multi-step-ahead-predictions
This repository holds code for the following multi-step-ahead prediction methods: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, stacked RNN, stacked LSTM network, and stacked GRU. Each method's performance is measured in terms of prediction accuracy using MBE, MAPE, and RMSE, as well as average computational run-time. The methods are trained on the univariate time series of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) from satellite-measured data across varying locations throughout the United States.  We predict GHI for five years using both short and long-term prediction intervals.
